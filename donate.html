        <h2>Causes to Donate To</h2>
        <p><b>Micro-Finance Program</b><br>
            Donating to support the Micro-Finance Program would support a Haitian citizen's business, and provide a scholarship for one child of the family. Selected participants would pay back the loan portion of the money. So far Haitian Hope has been able do 2 rounds of 10 parents. This Project requires $3500 in seed money to start a cycle, and $1200 each cycle after that.
            <br><b>Support a Child's Education</b><br>
            Donating to support a child's education can help students in elementary school through college. Tuition for a child's education from elementary to high school would cost anywhere $250 to 550 for one year. You could also help fund someone through med-school, which would cost $1750 per year for seven years.
            <br><b>Build an Orphanage</b><br>
            The ASCAH Orphelina is need of a building that is livable for the orphans they have been housing. They have been in operation since July 20,2010 after the earthquake, working with the little provisions they have. Currently they could use liveable dormitories for both the boys and girls to stay.
            <br><b>Build two Youth Pavilions</b><br>
            Both Pergame and Gozen Churches are in need of youth pavilions for their church. These pavilions serve as community centers, a place for children to learn, play and interact not just on Saturdays but also during the week. Estimated costs for this project amount to $10,000.
            <br><b>Establish and Sustain a Mobile Clinic</b><br>
            On this most recent mission trip, our medical volunteers found many people with critcally high blood pressure amongst other things. It would be very helpful if Haitian Hope could establish and maintain a free mobile clinic focused on holistic wellness, and natural healing to educate Haitian citizens about health, and treat sickness. The estimated cost for this endeavor $600/mo for medication, and $1200/mo for food.
