            <br>
            Social:  What you guys recently made in our community was incredible.  Families and specially kids were   blessed from all you shared with them. Some will stay as memorials for those who can not afford to purchase.
            Personally , I am blessed to  partnering with the organization that you guys are running.  Thank you for everything  and hope to work more with you together.

            Again, it  was a blessing for the community to have you , sharing knowledge and responded to some of their primary
            need that they struggle for every day. the food distribution came on time where they were in need for. It was also a pleasure for putting Joy and smiles in many faces during your trip. We are always please to work as partner with HHHE.
            <br>
            We have some short and long term projects that we would love HHHE to keep in mind:
            <br>
            1- A short term project,  we have 8 kids that we want to put in school this year, each child will need $220 for the year.
            <br>
            2- Also we have a feeding program that we want to keep going .
            <br>
            3- Buy a piece of land where we will be able to have more than 130 kids and build a center that could hold , training  in many disciplines. that is for long term project.
            <br>
            Blessings.

            Gosen Church is pleased every year for the presence of the group in the country and the services it provides. This year the church has greatly appreciated the mission the group has offered to the church. Parents loved the way you appreciated the children on Saturday morning when you arrived. Church members appreciated your presence in the service. For the consultation it is so important to the church, the leaders hope you would do it another day, on Sundays for those who are not Adventist to attend. The Children's department thanks the group for the program you have allowed them to perform. We ask the group to think about the project that we have submitted. We hope that God will continue to accompany you in the mission that he has given you on earth

            ASCASH Children's Emergency Orphanage at Bizoton 53. The orphanage is founded on July 20, 2010, after the passage of the earthquake of January 12, 2010. From 2010 to 2013, this orphanage was located at Thor 65, rue rose garden # 20. From 2011 to 2019, the orphanage received the visit of the group Haitian Hope Humanitarian Effort (HHHE) led by Mrs. Weslyne.  During their visits, the orphanage received the following donations: school supplies, clothing, educational games, financial and medical assistance. Then, from September 2013 to today, the orphanage relocated to Bizoton 53 prol, Larame # 16.  The group took the initiative to pay the university for a youth who resided at the orphanage, he responds to the name of Cadet Williams: On July 3, 2019, the group HHHE  had come to Haiti to give assistance to poor people, they organized a great cultural social activity with the children of the orphanage, the group had spent a day in the orphanage, it was an atmosphere of wonderful joy and extraordinary fun.  The group members had the opportunity to eat with the children and the leaders of the orphanage.  Before their departure, the group donated the following donations to the orphanage: Educational games, health kits, clothes and sheets, toiletries, and, financial assistance.  Thank you!!!

            <b>Observation from a med school student volunteer 2019</b><br><br>
            My name is Cadet William, I live at carrefour(Haiti), this year I had possibility to participate with HHHE in some activities they did in Haiti specially at carrefour. Clinic mobile (consultation) is one of these activities who helped me understand a lot of things about health in Haiti .
            <br>
            I met a lot of people who don't have access or not able to go to the Hospital, I got many men and women are suffering hypertension, anemia, blood sugar (Diabetic) digestion problems, pain and so on.
            <br>
            After this period I got a little time to think about these poor people who sick but don't have healthy access then I think also about my mission as a physician to resolve this problème.
            <br>
            It was a wonderful moment for me to start with this great works that is helping others (the poor and the orphans) I hope GOD will help you to increase or to Develop HHHE (to do HHHE biggest) so
            that to help more people in Haiti and in around the World . Next time I would like you do
            more consultations in some different adventist churches  and go in the countryside  like
            Plaisance, Marmalade and so forth for helping
            even more other vulnerable people.  Thank you.
            MAY GOD BLESS YOU.

            <b>Impact of Work in Pergame 2019</b><br><br>
            The mission to Haiti  by the HHHE group from June 28 to July 5 was a blessing of God!
            <br>
            Sunday, June 30 at the ADVENTIST PERGAME D'HAITI church, a campaign of consultation and distribution of remedies  and reliefs were held. Many people have been impacted by this campaign, about 400 of them.  On July 1, 2019, HHHE also visited the CARREFOUR MATERNITY HOSPITAL. Several mothers have received a care package and a Bible as part of strengthening homes  by referring them to greatest support, the Word, the Rock. (an evangelization effort). We conducted seminar and trained mother’s on how to perform baby massages. Despite all this achievement, there is still a lot to do.
            <br>
            We have received many people with high blood pressure and high-risk hyperglycemia a continuity of a mobile clinic would be useful and necessary
            <br>
            A new pavilion to reunite with children on Saturdays and other occasions id also be important.
            <br>
            With the appalling poverty in Haiti, financial assistance for the small traders (micro finance) of the Pergame and Gosen Adventist Churches would be an act of charity like no other.
