                <p class = "pptP">Wow!!! I have to say that I had a blast during the HHHE mission trip of 2019. I had
                    the chance to work and help the VBS team leader for the whole trip and worked with the health team
                    on Saturday afternoon. I also had the opportunity to work alongside our very own eye technician and
                    then with our physician team. That is what you called flexibility working wherever the Lord
                    leads.<br> <em>Guirlene Durosier</em></p>

                <h3>Steps to Wellness</h3>
                <p class = "pptP">Steps to Wellness was the theme for the Haiti mission trip 2019. The emphasis was
                    on the Source of healing and natural remedies that He has placed at his children’s disposal. At all
                    the locations, God as the foundation of all healing was highlighted. Our wonderful Heavenly Father
                    is no respecter of persons and the solutions that He has the common diseases of Diabetes,
                    hypertension and Cardiovascular were within the reach of all….including HIS children in Haiti.
